                <p>1. Many contractions which would normally be printed together in their shortened form are left spaced, as printed. Sometimes this is done due to the meter of the poem. Other times it is just the older way that printers handled these words. The original was not always consistent about how these were handled, and may have been contracted to save space.</p>
                <p>2. Since this book has a significant amount of dialect, no attempt was made to change any odd spellings. Some of these words are not easy to translate, but usually the context will be sufficient. For instance, the word <em>stuhs</em> means stirs, as, 'dat melody stuhs me up'.</p>

                    <l>The past which held its share of bitter pain,</l>

                <lg type="stanza">
                    <l>A song is but a little thing,</l>
                    <l>And yet what joy it is to sing!</l>
                    <l>In hours of toil it gives me zest,</l>
                    <l>And when at eve I long for rest;</l>
                    <l>When cows come home along the bars,</l>
                    <l>And in the fold I hear the bell,</l>
                    <l>As Night, the shepherd, herds his stars,</l>
                    <l>I sing my song, and all is well.</l>

                    <l>There are no ears to hear my lays,</l>
                    <l>No lips to lift a word of praise;</l>
                    <l>But still, with faith unfaltering,</l>
                    <l>I live and laugh and love and sing.</l>
                    <l>What matters yon unheeding throng?</l>
                    <l>They cannot feel my spirit's spell,</l>
                    <l>Since life is sweet and love is long,</l>
                    <l>I sing my song, and all is well.</l>

                    <l>My days are never days of ease;</l>
                    <l>I till my ground and prune my trees.</l>
                    <l>When ripened gold is all the plain,</l>
                    <l>I put my sickle to the grain.</l>
                    <l>I labor hard, and toil and sweat,</l>
                    <l>While others dream within the dell;</l>
                    <l>But even while my brow is wet,</l>
                    <l>I sing my song, and all is well.</l>

                    <l>Sometimes the sun, unkindly hot,</l>
                    <l>My garden makes a desert spot;</l>
                    <l>Sometimes a blight upon the tree</l>
                    <l>Takes all my fruit away from me;</l>
                    <l>And then with throes of bitter pain</l>
                    <l>Rebellious passions rise and swell;</l>
                    <l>But—life is more than fruit or grain,</l>
                    <l>And so I sing, and all is well.</l>

                    <l>My cot was down by a cypress grove,</l>
                    <l>And I sat by my window the whole night long,</l>
                    <l>And heard well up from the deep dark wood</l>
                    <l>A mocking-bird's passionate song.</l>

                    <l>And I said, "I can cheer some other soul</l>

                        <l>Done are the toils and the wearisome marches,</l>
                        <l>Done is the summons of bugle and drum.</l>

                        <l>Shelt'ring a land where Rebellion is dumb.</l>
                        <l>Dark were the days of the country's derangement,</l>

                        <l>Have written fair verse that has sweetened the world;</l>
                        <l>Why, then, should not I give the space of an hour</l>
                        <l>To making a song in return for a flower?</l>
                        <l>I have found in my life—it has not been so long—</l>
                        <l>There are too few of flowers—too little of song.</l>
                        <l>So out of that blossom, this lay of mine grows,</l>
                        <l>For the dear little lady who gave me the rose.</l>

                        <l>Well, Zeke an' me went on that way</l>
                        <l>An' fussed an' quarrelled day by day;</l>
                        <l>While Liza, mindin' not the fuss,</l>

                        <l>Was jest plum mad with jealousy.</l>
                        <l>Well, fur a time we kep' our places,</l>

                        <l>One night ('t was fair, you'll all agree)</l>
                        <l>I got Eliza's company,</l>
                        <l>An' leavin' Zekel in the lurch,</l>
                        <l>Went trottin' off with her to church.</l>

                        <l>When Zekel come a-bouncin' in</l>
                        <l>As furious as the law allows.</l>
                        <l>He 'd jest be'n up to Liza's house,</l>
                        <l>To find her gone, then come to church</l>
                        <l>To have this end put to his search.</l>
                        <l>I guess I laffed that meetin' through,</l>
                        <l>An' not a mortal word I knew</l>
                        <l>Of what the preacher preached er read</l>
                        <l>Er what the choir sung er said.</l>
                        <L>Fur Every Time I 'D Turn My head</L>
                        <l>I could n't skeercely help but see</l>
                        <l>'At Zekel had his eye on me.</l>
                        <l>An' he 'ud sort o' turn an' twist</l>
                        <l>An' grind his teeth an' shake his fist.</l>
                        <l>I laughed, fur la! the hull church seen us,</l>
                        <l>An' knowed that suthin' was between us.</l>
                        <l>Well, meetin' out, we started hum,</l>
                        <l>I sorter feelin' what would come.</l>
                        <l>We 'd jest got out, when up stepped Zeke,</l>
                        <l>An' said, "Scuse me, I 'd like to speak</l>
                        <l>To you a minute." "Cert," said I—</l>
                        <l>A-nudgin' Liza on the sly</l>
                        <l>An' laughin' in my sleeve with glee,</l>
                        <l>I asked her, please, to pardon me.</l>
                        <l>We walked away a step er two,</l>
                        <l>Jest to git out o' Liza's view,</l>
                        <l>An' then Zeke said, "I want to know</l>
                        <l>Ef you think you 're Eliza's beau,</l>
                        <l>An' 'at I 'm goin' to let her go</l>
                        <l>Hum with sich a chap as you?"</l>
                        <l>An' I said bold, "You bet I do."</l>
                        <l>Then Zekel, sneerin', said 'at he</l>
                        <l>Did n't want to hender me.</l>
                        <l>But then he 'lowed the gal was his</l>
                        <l>An' 'at he guessed he knowed his biz,</l>
                        <l>An' was n't feared o' all my kin</l>
                        <l>With all my friends an' chums throwed in.</l>
                        <l>Some other things he mentioned there</l>
                        <l>That no born man could no ways bear</l>
                        <l>Er think o' ca'mly tryin' to stan'</l>
                        <l>Ef Zeke had be'n the bigges' man</l>
                        <l>In town, an' not the leanest runt</l>
                        <l>'At time an' labor ever stunt.</l>
                        <l>An' so I let my fist go "bim,"</l>
                        <l>I thought I 'd mos' nigh finished him.</l>
                        <l>But Zekel did n't take it so.</l>
                        <l>He jest ducked down an' dodged my blow</l>
                        <l>An' then come back at me so hard,</l>
                        <l>I guess I must 'a' hurt the yard,</l>
                        <l>Er spilet the grass plot where I fell,</l>
                        <l>An' sakes alive it hurt me; well,</l>
                        <l>It would n't be'n so bad, you see,</l>
                        <l>But he jest kep' a-hittin' me.</l>
                        <l>An' I hit back an' kicked an' pawed,</l>
                        <l>But 't seemed 't was mostly air I clawed,</l>
                        <l>While Zekel used his science well</l>
                        <l>A-makin' every motion tell.</l>
                        <l>He punched an' hit, why, goodness lands,</l>
                        <l>Seemed like he had a dozen hands.</l>
                        <l>Well, afterwhile they stopped the fuss,</l>
                        <l>An' some one kindly parted us.</l>
                        <l>All beat an' cuffed an' clawed an' scratched,</l>
                        <l>An' needin' both our faces patched,</l>
                        <l>Each started hum a different way;</l>
                        <l>An' what o' Liza, do you say,</l>
                        <l>Why, Liza—little humbug—dern her,</l>
                        <l>Why, she 'd gone home with Hiram Turner.</l>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>A lover whom duty called over the wave,</l>
                        <l>With himself communed: "Will my love be true</l>
                        <l>If left to herself? Had I better not sue</l>
                        <l>Some friend to watch over her, good and grave?</l>
                        <l>But my friend might fail in my need," he said,</l>
                        <l>"And I return to find love dead.</l>
                        <l>Since friendships fade like the flow'rs of June,</l>
                        <l>I will leave her in charge of the stable moon."</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Then he said to the moon: "O dear old moon,</l>
                        <l>Who for years and years from thy thrown above</l>
                        <l>Hast nurtured and guarded young lovers and love,</l>
                        <l>My heart has but come to its waiting June,</l>

                        <l>Oh, guard thee well this love of mine."</l>
                        <l>And he harked him then while all was still,</l>
                        <l>And the pale moon answered and said, "I will."</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>And he sailed in his ship o'er many seas,</l>
                        <l>And he wandered wide o'er strange far strands:</l>
                        <l>In isles of the south and in Orient lands,</l>
                        <l>Where pestilence lurks in the breath of the breeze.</l>
                        <l>But his star was high, so he braved the main,</l>
                        <l>And sailed him blithely home again;</l>
                        <l>And with joy he bended his footsteps soon</l>
                        <l>To learn of his love from the matron moon.</l>

                        <l>She sat as of yore, in her olden place,</l>
                        <l>Serene as death, in her silver chair.</l>
                        <l>A white rose gleamed in her whiter hair,</l>
                        <l>And the tint of a blush was on her face.</l>
                        <l>At sight of the youth she sadly bowed</l>
                        <l>And hid her face 'neath a gracious cloud.</l>
                        <l>She faltered faint on the night's dim marge,</l>
                        <l>But "How," spoke the youth, "have you kept your charge?"</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>The moon was sad at a trust ill-kept;</l>
                        <l>The blush went out in her blanching cheek,</l>
                        <l>And her voice was timid and low and weak,</l>
                        <l>As she made her plea and sighed and wept.</l>
                        <l>"Oh, another prayed and another plead,</l>
                        <l>And I could n't resist," she answering said;</l>
                        <l>"But love still grows in the hearts of men:</l>
                        <l>Go forth, dear youth, and love again."</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>But he turned him away from her proffered grace.</l>
                        <l>"Thou art false, O moon, as the hearts of men,</l>
                        <l>I will not, will not love again."</l>
                        <l>And he turned sheer 'round with a soul-sick face</l>
                        <l>To the sea, and cried: "Sea, curse the moon,</l>
                        <l>Who makes her vows and forgets so soon."</l>
                        <l>And the awful sea with anger stirred,</l>
                        <l>And his breast heaved hard as he lay and heard.</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>And ever the moon wept down in rain,</l>
                        <l>And ever her sighs rose high in wind;</l>
                        <l>But the earth and sea were deaf and blind,</l>
                        <l>And she wept and sighed her griefs in vain.</l>
                        <l>And ever at night, when the storm is fierce,</l>
                        <l>The cries of a wraith through the thunder pierce;</l>

                        <l>An' all us youngsters clambered in an' down the road went bobbin'</l>
                        <l>To school where we was kep' at work in every kind o' weather,</l>
                        <l>But where that night a spellin'-bee was callin' us together.</l>
                        <l>'Twas one o' Heaven's banner nights, the stars was all a glitter,</l>
                        <l>The moon was shinin' like the hand o' God had jest then lit her.</l>
                        <l>The ground was white with spotless snow, the blast was sort o' stingin';</l>
                        <l>But underneath our round-abouts, you bet our hearts was singin'.</l>
                        <l>That spellin'-bee had be'n the talk o' many a precious moment,</l>
                        <l>The youngsters all was wild to see jes' what the precious show meant,</l>
                        <l>An' we whose years was in their teens was little less desirous</l>
                        <l>O' gittin' to the meetin' so 's our sweethearts could admire us.</l>
                        <l>So on we went so anxious fur to satisfy our mission</l>
                        <l>That father had to box our ears, to smother our ambition.</l>
                        <l>But boxin' ears was too short work to hinder our arrivin',</l>
                        <l>He jest turned roun' an' smacked us all, an' kep' right on a-drivin'.</l>
                        <l>Well, soon the schoolhouse hove in sight, the winders beamin' brightly;</l>
                        <l>The sound o' talkin' reached our ears, and voices laffin' lightly.</l>
                        <l>It puffed us up so full an' big 'at I 'll jest bet a dollar,</l>
                        <l>There wa'n't a feller there but felt the strain upon his collar.</l>
                        <l>So down we jumped an' in we went ez sprightly ez you make 'em,</l>
                        <l>But somethin' grabbed us by the knees an' straight began to shake 'em.</l>
                        <l>Fur once within that lighted room, our feelin's took a canter,</l>
                        <l>An' scurried to the zero mark ez quick ez Tam O'Shanter.</l>
                        <l>'Cause there was crowds o' people there, both sexes an' all stations;</l>
                        <l>It looked like all the town had come an' brought all their relations.</l>
                        <l>The first I saw was Nettie Gray, I thought that girl was dearer</l>
                        <l>'N' gold; an' when I got a chance, you bet I aidged up near her.</l>
                        <l>An' Farmer Dobbs's girl was there, the one 'at Jim was sweet on,</l>

                        <l>Then Parson Brown an' Lawyer Jones were present—all attention,</l>
                        <l>An' piles on piles of other folks too numerous to mention.</l>
                        <l>The master rose an' briefly said: "Good friends, dear brother Crawford,</l>
                        <l>To spur the pupils' minds along, a little prize has offered.</l>
                        <l>To him who spells the best to-night—or 't may be 'her'—no tellin'—</l>
                        <l>He offers ez a jest reward, this precious work on spellin'."</l>
                        <l>A little blue-backed spellin'-book with fancy scarlet trimmin';</l>
                        <l>We boys devoured it with our eyes—so did the girls an' women.</l>
                        <l>He held it up where all could see, then on the table set it,</l>
                        <l>An' ev'ry speller in the house felt mortal bound to get it.</l>
                        <l>At his command we fell in line, prepared to do our dooty,</l>
                        <l>Outspell the rest an' set 'em down, an' carry home the booty.</l>
                        <l>'T was then the merry times began, the blunders, an' the laffin',</l>
                        <l>The nudges an' the nods an' winks an' stale good-natured chaffin'.</l>
                        <l>Ole Uncle Hiram Dane was there, the clostest man a-livin',</l>
                        <l>Whose only bugbear seemed to be the dreadful fear o' givin'.</l>
                        <l>His beard was long, his hair uncut, his clothes all bare an' dingy;</l>
                        <l>It wasn't 'cause the man was pore, but jest so mortal stingy;</l>
                        <l>An' there he sot by Sally Riggs a-smilin' an' a-smirkin',</l>
                        <l>An' all his children lef' to home a diggin' an' a-workin'.</l>
                        <l>A widower he was, an' Sal was thinkin' 'at she 'd wing him;</l>
                        <l>I reckon he was wond'rin' what them rings o' hern would bring him.</l>
                        <l>An' when the spellin'-test commenced, he up an' took his station,</l>
                        <l>A-spellin' with the best o' them to beat the very nation.</l>
                        <l>An' when he 'd spell some youngster down, he 'd turn to look at Sally,</l>
                        <l>An' say: "The teachin' nowadays can't be o' no great vally."</l>
                        <l>But true enough the adage says, "Pride walks in slipp'ry places,"</l>
                        <l>Fur soon a thing occurred that put a smile on all our faces.</l>
                        <l>The laffter jest kep' ripplin' 'roun' an' teacher could n't quell it,</l>
                        <l>Fur when he give out "charity" ole Hiram could n't spell it.</l>
                        <l>But laffin' 's ketchin' an' it throwed some others off their bases,</l>
                        <l>An' folks 'u'd miss the very word that seemed to fit their cases.</l>
                        <l>Why, fickle little Jessie Lee come near the house upsettin'</l>
                        <l>By puttin' in a double "kay" to spell the word "coquettin'."</l>
                        <l>An' when it come to Cyrus Jones, it tickled me all over—</l>
                        <l>Him settin' up to Mandy Smith an' got sot down on "lover."</l>
                        <l>But Lawyer Jones of all gone men did shorely look the gonest,</l>
                        <l>When he found out that he 'd furgot to put the "h" in "honest."</l>
                        <l>An' Parson Brown, whose sermons were too long fur toleration,</l>
                        <l>Caused lots o' smiles by missin' when they give out "condensation."</l>
                        <l>So one by one they giv' it up—the big words kep' a-landin',</l>
                        <l>Till me an' Nettie Gray was left, the only ones a-standin',</l>
                        <l>An' then my inward strife began—I guess my mind was petty—</l>
                        <l>I did so want that spellin'-book; but then to spell down Nettie</l>
                        <l>Jest sort o' went ag'in my grain—I somehow could n't do it,</l>
                        <l>An' when I git a notion fixed, I 'm great on stickin' to it.</l>
                        <l>So when they giv' the next word out—I had n't orter tell it,</l>
                        <l>But then 't was all fur Nettie's sake—I missed so's she could spell it.</l>
                        <l>She spelt the word, then looked at me so lovin'-like an' mello',</l>
                        <l>I tell you 't sent a hunderd pins a shootin' through a fello'.</l>
                        <l>O' course I had to stand the jokes an' chaffin' of the fello's,</l>
                        <l>But when they handed her the book I vow I was n't jealous.</l>
                        <l>We sung a hymn, an' Parson Brown dismissed us like he orter,</l>
                        <l>Fur, la! he 'd learned a thing er two an' made his blessin' shorter.</l>
                        <l>'T was late an' cold when we got out, but Nettie liked cold weather,</l>
                        <l>An' so did I, so we agreed we 'd jest walk home together.</l>
                        <l>We both wuz silent, fur of words we nuther had a surplus,</l>
                        <l>'Till she spoke out quite sudden like, "You missed that word on purpose."</l>
                        <l>Well, I declare it frightened me; at first I tried denyin',</l>
                        <l>But Nettie, she jest smiled an' smiled, she knowed that I was lyin'.</l>
                        <l>Sez she: "That book is yourn by right;" sez I: "It never could be—</l>
                        <l>I—I—you—ah—" an' there I stuck, an' well she understood me.</l>
                        <l>So we agreed that later on when age had giv' us tether,</l>
                        <l>We 'd jine our lots an' settle down to own that book together.</l>

                        <l>Shall light our footsteps to the goal.</l>

                        <l>To me, like hauntings of a vagrant breath</l>
                        <l>From some far forest which I once have known,</l>
                        <l>The perfume of this flower of verse is blown.</l>
                        <l>Tho' seemingly soul-blossoms faint to death,</l>
                        <l>Naught that with joy she bears e'er withereth.</l>
                        <l>So, tho' the pregnant years have come and flown,</l>
                        <l>Lives come and gone and altered like mine own,</l>
                        <l>This poem comes to me a shibboleth:</l>
                        <l>Brings sound of past communings to my ear,</l>
                        <l>Turns round the tide of time and bears me back</l>
                        <l>Along an old and long untraversed way;</l>
                        <l>Makes me forget this is a later year,</l>
                        <l>Makes me tread o'er a reminiscent track,</l>
                        <l>Half sad, half glad, to one forgotten day!</l>

                        <l>Looked into your eyes so true,</l>
                        <l>Just to see if you were loving</l>
                        <l>Me as I was loving you.</l>

                        <l>You should see a fuller summer</l>
                        <l>And an autumn by my side.</l>

                        <l>A man of low degree was sore oppressed,</l>

                        <l>Waged, prayerless, on his losing fight with Fate.</l>

                        <l>Friends gave his proffered hand their coldest clasp,</l>
                        <l>Or took it not at all; and Poverty,</l>
                        <l>That bruised his body with relentless grasp,</l>
                        <l>Grinned, taunting, when he struggled to be free.</l>
                        <l>But though with helpless hands he beat the air,</l>
                        <l>His need extreme yet found no voice in prayer.</l>

                        <l>Then he prevailed; and forthwith snobbish Fate,</l>

                        <l>Lay a banjo, droning forth this reminiscent melody:</l>

                        <l>Men may sing of their Havanas, elevating to the stars</l>
                        <l>The real or fancied virtues of their foreign-made cigars;</l>
                        <l>But I worship Nicotina at a different sort of shrine,</l>
                        <l>And she sits enthroned in glory in this corn-cob pipe of mine.</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>It 's as fragrant as the meadows when the clover is in bloom;</l>
                        <l>It 's as dainty as the essence of the daintiest perfume;</l>
                        <l>It 's as sweet as are the orchards when the fruit is hanging ripe,</l>
                        <l>With the sun's warm kiss upon them—is this corn-cob pipe.</l>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Thro' the smoke about it clinging, I delight its form to trace,</l>
                        <l>Like an oriental beauty with a veil upon her face;</l>
                        <l>And my room is dim with vapour as a church when censers sway,</l>
                        <l>As I clasp it to my bosom—in a figurative way.</l>
                    </lg>

                    <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>It consoles me in misfortune and it cheers me in distress,</l>
                        <l>And it proves a warm partaker of my pleasures in success;</l>
                        <l>So I hail it as a symbol, friendship's true and worthy type,</l>
                        <l>And I press my lips devoutly to my corn-cob pipe.</l>

                        <l>An' I reckon ef you 'd search the map you could n't find a trace</l>
                        <l>Of any sich locality as this I 've named to you;</l>
                        <l>But never mind, I know the place, an' I love it dearly too.</l>
                        <l>It don't make no pretensions to bein' great or fine,</l>
                        <l>The circuses don't come that way, they ain't no railroad line.</l>
                        <l>It ain't no great big city, where the schemers plan an' plot,</l>
                        <l>But jest a little settlement, this place called Possum Trot.</l>

                        <l>Why, there was Hannah Dyer, you may search this teemin' earth</l>

                        <l>It seems like I kin hear him talk, an' hear his hearty laugh.</l>
                        <l>His heart was big an' cheery as a sunny acre lot,</l>

                        <l>Caught Susanner whistlin'; well,</l>
                        <l>It's most nigh too good to tell.</l>
                        <l>'Twould 'a' b'en too good to see</l>
                        <l>Ef it had n't b'en fur me,</l>
                        <l>Comin' up so soft an' sly</l>
                        <l>That she didn' hear me nigh.</l>
                        <l>I was pokin' 'round that day,</l>
                        <l>An' ez I come down the way,</l>
                        <l>First her whistle strikes my ears,—</l>
                        <l>Then her gingham dress appears;</l>
                        <l>So with soft step up I slips.</l>
                        <l>Oh, them dewy, rosy lips!</l>
                        <l>Ripe ez cherries, red an' round,</l>
                        <l>Puckered up to make the sound.</l>
                        <l>She was lookin' in the spring,</l>
                        <l>Whistlin' to beat anything,—</l>
                        <l>"Kitty Dale" er "In the Sweet."</l>
                        <l>I was jest so mortal beat</l>
                        <l>That I can't quite ricoleck</l>
                        <l>What the toon was, but I 'speck</l>
                        <l>'T was some hymn er other, fur</l>
                        <l>Hymny things is jest like her.</l>
                        <l>Well she went on fur awhile</l>
                        <l>With her face all in a smile,</l>
                        <l>An' I never moved, but stood</l>
                        <l>Stiller 'n a piece o' wood—</l>
                        <l>Would n't wink ner would n't stir,</l>
                        <l>But a-gazin' right at her,</l>
                        <l>Tell she turns an' sees me—my!</l>
                        <l>Thought at first she 'd try to fly.</l>
                        <l>But she blushed an' stood her ground.</l>
                        <l>Then, a-slyly lookin' round,</l>
                        <l>She says: "Did you hear me, Ben?"</l>
                        <l>"Whistlin' woman, crowin' hen,"</l>
                        <l>Says I, lookin' awful stern.</l>
                        <l>Then the red commenced to burn</l>
                        <l>In them cheeks o' hern. Why, la!</l>
                        <l>Reddest red you ever saw—</l>
                        <l>Pineys wa'n't a circumstance.</l>
                        <l>You 'd 'a' noticed in a glance</l>
                        <l>She was pow'rful shamed an' skeart;</l>
                        <l>But she looked so sweet an' peart,</l>
                        <L>That A Idee Struck My head;</L>
                        <l>So I up an' slowly said:</l>
                        <l>"Woman whistlin' brings shore harm,</l>
                        <l>Jest one thing 'll break the charm."</l>
                        <l>"And what's that?" "Oh, my!" says I,</l>
                        <l>"I don't like to tell you." "Why?"</l>
                        <l>Says Susanner. "Well, you see</l>
                        <l>It would kinder fall on me."</l>
                        <l>Course I knowed that she 'd insist,—</l>
                        <l>So I says: "You must be kissed</l>
                        <l>By the man that heard you whistle;</l>
                        <l>Everybody says that this 'll</l>
                        <l>Break the charm and set you free</l>
                        <l>From the threat'nin' penalty."</l>
                        <l>She was blushin' fit to kill,</l>
                        <l>But she answered, kinder still:</l>
                        <l>"I don't want to have no harm,</l>
                        <l>Please come, Ben, an' break the charm."</l>
                        <l>Did I break that charm?—oh, well,</l>
                        <l>There's some things I must n't tell.</l>
                        <l>I remember, afterwhile,</l>
                        <l>Her a-sayin' with a smile:</l>
                        <l>"Oh, you quit,—you sassy dunce,</l>
                        <l>You jest caught me whistlin' <i>once</i>."

                            <l>Hurt was the nation with a mighty wound,</l>
                            <l>And all her ways were filled with clam'rous sound.</l>
                            <l>Wailed loud the South with unremitting grief,</l>
                            <l>And wept the North that could not find relief.</l>
                            <l>Then madness joined its harshest tone to strife:</l>
                            <l>A minor note swelled in the song of life.</l>
                            <l>'Till, stirring with the love that filled his breast,</l>
                            <l>But still, unflinching at the right's behest,</l>
                            <l>Grave Lincoln came, strong handed, from afar,</l>
                            <l>The mighty Homer of the lyre of war.</l>
                            <l>'T was he who bade the raging tempest cease,</l>
                            <l>Wrenched from his harp the harmony of peace,</l>
                            <l>Muted the strings, that made the discord,—Wrong,</l>
                            <l>And gave his spirit up in thund'rous song.</l>
                            <l>Oh mighty Master of the mighty lyre,</l>
                            <l>Earth heard and trembled at thy strains of fire:</l>
                            <l>Earth learned of thee what Heav'n already knew,</l>
                            <l>And wrote thee down among her treasured few.</l>

                            <l>A song for the unsung heroes who rose in the country's need,</l>
                            <l>When the life of the land was threatened by the slaver's cruel greed,</l>
                            <l>For the men who came from the cornfield, who came from the plough and the flail,</l>
                            <l>Who rallied round when they heard the sound of the mighty man of the rail.</l>

                            <l>They fought their way on the hillside, they fought their way in the glen,</l>
                            <l>And God looked down on their sinews brown, and said, "I have made them men."</l>

                            <l>The gray lines rose and melted beneath their scathing showers,</l>

                            <l>Do you dread the ice-clad streams,—</l>
                            <l>They are mirrors for your dreams.</l>
                            <l>Here's a rouse, when summer's past</l>
                            <l>To the raging winter's blast.</l>
                            <l>Let him roar and let him rout,</l>
                            <l>We are armored for the bout.</l>
                            <l>How the logs are glowing, see!</l>
                            <l>Who sings louder, they or he?</l>
                            <l>Could the city be more gay?</l>
                            <l>Burn your bridges! Come away!</l>

                        <head>In Summer Time</head>

                        <lg type="stanza">
                            <l>When summer time has come, and all</l>
                            <l>The world is in the magic thrall</l>
                            <l>Of perfumed airs that lull each sense</l>
                            <l>To fits of drowsy indolence;</l>
                            <l>When skies are deepest blue above,</l>
                            <l>And flow'rs aflush,—then most I love</l>
                            <l>To start, while early dews are damp,</l>
                            <l>And wend my way in woodland tramp</l>
                            <l>Where forests rustle, tree on tree,</l>
                            <l>And sing their silent songs to me;</l>
                            <l>Where pathways meet and path ways part,—</l>
                            <l>To walk with Nature heart by heart,</l>
                            <l>Till wearied out at last I lie</l>
                            <l>Where some sweet stream steals singing by</l>
                            <l>A mossy bank; where violets vie</l>
                            <l>In color with the summer sky,—</l>
                            <l>Or take my rod and line and hook,</l>
                            <l>And wander to some darkling brook,</l>
                            <l>Where all day long the willows dream,</l>
                            <l>And idly droop to kiss the stream,</l>
                            <l>And there to loll from morn till night—</l>
                            <l>Unheeding nibble, run, or bite—</l>
                            <l>Just for the joy of being there</l>
                            <l>And drinking in the summer air,</l>
                            <l>The summer sounds, and summer sights,</l>
                            <l>That set a restless mind to rights</l>
                            <l>When grief and pain and raging doubt</l>
                            <l>Of men and creeds have worn it out;</l>
                            <l>The birds' song and the water's drone,</l>
                            <l>The humming bees' low monotone,</l>
                            <l>The murmur of the passing breeze,</l>
                            <l>And all the sounds akin to these,</l>
                            <l>That make a man in summer time</l>
                            <l>Feel only fit for rest and rhyme.</l>
                            <l>Joy springs all radiant in my breast;</l>
                            <l>Though pauper poor, than king more blest,</l>
                            <l>The tide beats in my soul so strong</l>
                            <l>That happiness breaks forth in song,</l>
                            <l>And rings aloud the welkin blue</l>
                            <l>With all the songs I ever knew.</l>
                            <l>O time of rapture! time of song!</l>
                            <l>How swiftly glide thy days along</l>
                            <l>Adown the current of the years,</l>
                            <l>Above the rocks of grief and tears!</l>
                            <l>'Tis wealth enough of joy for me</l>
                            <l>In summer time to simply be.</l>

                            <l>Is more to me now than the path of the stars.</l>
